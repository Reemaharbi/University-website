University Website Recreation Project

This project is a faithful recreation of my university's official website, specifically focusing on the College of Computing and Informatics. Using HTML and CSS, I have meticulously crafted multiple pages to reflect the structure, design, and content of the original site.

Features

Multi-page Layout: The project includes several pages such as Home, About Us, Departments, Faculty, Courses, and Contact Us.
Responsive Design: Ensures the website is accessible and looks great on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Accurate Styling: Careful attention has been paid to the CSS to replicate the exact look and feel of the university's website.
Navigation: A fully functional navigation bar allows users to easily move between different sections of the website.
